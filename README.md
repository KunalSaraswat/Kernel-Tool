Linux Kernel Master Tool
A comprehensive guide to understanding the Linux Kernel architecture, subsystems, and development.
Overview
The Linux Kernel Master Tool is an extensive resource created by Kunal Saraswat to help developers, system administrators, and enthusiasts dive deep into the Linux kernel. This project covers critical aspects of the kernel, including its architecture, boot process, process management, memory management, filesystems, device drivers, networking, kernel modules, debugging tools, and development practices. It includes detailed explanations, practical examples, and code snippets to facilitate learning and hands-on experimentation.
Features

In-Depth Topics: Covers core kernel subsystems like process scheduling, memory management, filesystems, device drivers, and networking.
Practical Examples: Includes C programs, kernel modules, and shell commands to demonstrate concepts like system calls, process creation, and driver development.
Interactive Demos: Features interactive JavaScript-based simulations for process scheduling and kernel log visualization.
Version Information: Details Linux kernel versioning, including stable (e.g., 6.9.5 as of May 2025) and Long-Term Support (LTS) releases.
Debugging Tools: Guides on using tools like dmesg, ftrace, perf, and GDB for kernel debugging.
Development Resources: Step-by-step instructions for building kernel modules and custom kernels, with recommended learning resources.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Operating System: Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux).
Tools:
GCC and Make for compiling C programs and kernel modules.
Git for cloning kernel source code.
Root privileges for certain operations (e.g., loading kernel modules, debugging).
